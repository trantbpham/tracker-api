Chapter 5: <br />


Chapter 4:<br /><br /> 
** Functionality: For this section, I was able to handle event by using bind() and a handleSubmit() functionthis, allowing users to add their own log, instead of just showing static log like before. Additionally, this event handle can happen due to the async state initialization. allowing user to update a log, and showcase it in the table. <br />
** Challenges: I didn't have much technical difficulties for this section, most of the issues were due to typos or missing brakets, which were easy fixes. I'm still not getting used to the way the book is written. I found myself hard to follow, had to scroll to see the entire code in order to visual, then come back to that specific section to further understand what they mean. So in general, it's just a bit interrupted in terms of reading flow and thinking process. <br /> <br />

Chapter 3:<br /><br /> 
** Functionality: For Chapter 3, I was able to build a website that tracks issues, similarly to JIRA, using React Components. The data is also able to pass to the children and create the nested element. <br />
** Challenges: The book didn’t clearly explain when to use JavaScript, and when to use HTML/CSS—so I have to look up and gain high level background information on when to use each of the language. I’m also still trying to get comfortable with learning how to use the port and the commands for gitBash.<br /><br />

Chapter 2: <br /><br /> 
** Functionality: the "Hello World" I implemented following the book able to translate and run the code in older browser, like Internet Explorer 11 using Babel. This helps transfer JFX to JavaScript. The website is also able to send the file to m y local server. I also used Express and Node.js <br />
** Challenges: When I was working on the files, it was a bit difficult to follow which folder individual files are supposed to be in. The other challenge I have is trying to remember the steps and the process for future implementation. <br /><br />
