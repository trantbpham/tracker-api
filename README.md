Chapter 2: <br />
** Functionality: the "Hello World" I implemented following the book able to translate and run the code in older browser, like Internet Explorer 11 using Babel. This helps transfer JFX to JavaScript. The website is also able to send the file to m y local server. I also used Express and Node.js <br />
** Challenges: When I was working on the files, it was a bit difficult to follow which folder individual files are supposed to be in. The other challenge I have is trying to remember the steps and the process for future implementation. <br />
