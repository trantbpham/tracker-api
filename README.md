Chapter 6: <br />

** Challenges: I had a lot of issues related to installing Mongo and utilizing Mongo making sure that it runs properly on my Windows computer. The book is very unclear in steps of utilizing MongoDB, what and how to use it. Installilng is fairly easy, but information on troubleshooting for Windows are very unclear. Additionally, there's a lot of solutions available online for Mac users, but for Windows, it's a bit unclear and has to do a lot of digging and playing around to figure out the problem. It'd be nice for the book to address how to tackle MongoDB issues on Windows. Other than that, utilizing MongoDB and syntax is fairly easy.

Chapter 5: <br />
** Functionality: while we were introduced both concepts: REST and GraphQL, the book proceed with introducing the GraphQL libraries and tools for us to use in order to build the issue tracker tool. We now have a ListAPI that needed to intergrated into the UI. In order to do that, we need to make asynchronous API calls (Ajax calls). Afterwards, we converted the date/time appearance on the web by using scalar for the conversion--the the time will appear correctly according to timezones. Finally, we're making adjustment so the input data is more flexible and doesn't have to hard code the data in.


** Challenges: I kept running into issues with installing the proper version of graphql. It was difficult to keep track of the correct npm command and the right graphql version, and therefore the server.js keeps crashing when trying to run. Afterwards, I was able to fix the issue by fixing the json file and upgrade to the correct graphql. The other issue I ran into was difficulty of keeping track of the right syntax from the graphQL, utilizing single quotes and double quotes, as well as spacing in the syntax.<br /> <br />

Chapter 4:<br /><br /> 
** Functionality: For this section, I was able to handle event by using bind() and a handleSubmit() functionthis, allowing users to add their own log, instead of just showing static log like before. Additionally, this event handle can happen due to the async state initialization. allowing user to update a log, and showcase it in the table. <br />
** Challenges: I didn't have much technical difficulties for this section, most of the issues were due to typos or missing brakets, which were easy fixes. I'm still not getting used to the way the book is written. I found myself hard to follow, had to scroll to see the entire code in order to visual, then come back to that specific section to further understand what they mean. So in general, it's just a bit interrupted in terms of reading flow and thinking process. <br /> <br />

Chapter 3:<br /><br /> 
** Functionality: For Chapter 3, I was able to build a website that tracks issues, similarly to JIRA, using React Components. The data is also able to pass to the children and create the nested element. <br />
** Challenges: The book didn’t clearly explain when to use JavaScript, and when to use HTML/CSS—so I have to look up and gain high level background information on when to use each of the language. I’m also still trying to get comfortable with learning how to use the port and the commands for gitBash.<br /><br />

Chapter 2: <br /><br /> 
** Functionality: the "Hello World" I implemented following the book able to translate and run the code in older browser, like Internet Explorer 11 using Babel. This helps transfer JFX to JavaScript. The website is also able to send the file to m y local server. I also used Express and Node.js <br />
** Challenges: When I was working on the files, it was a bit difficult to follow which folder individual files are supposed to be in. The other challenge I have is trying to remember the steps and the process for future implementation. <br /><br />
